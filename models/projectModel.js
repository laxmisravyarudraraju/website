    description: "Developing a web application to assist people in dealing with depression. Depression, in my opinion, is the most dangerous threat, regardless of age. It has been my primary concern for a variety of reasons. Many real life experiences have taught me that keeping people engaged in some type of activity can help people who are depressed. When in depression, some people eat a lot, some like to share their feelings, some want to do something to animals, some gets relieved by playing games, and so on. So every case is different.\nWhat I intend to do with this application is to link individuals and allow them to communicate with their connections list in the app via Live Chat and Video Calling, as well as to provide them with a dashboard with some customized activities to complete depending on a questionnaire about their current mental state. As well as cheering them up as they progress through the levels to send positive vibes.",
